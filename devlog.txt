Today was the start of our project devlog.
Bayle and I made and populated the readme.txt and devlog.txt files.
Now, we are going to wait for Mr. Brown's seal of approval on our project idea.
RIP David Bowie.

I worked on making Character an interface and making Character, Teacher and Hanna work in tandem
still needs work though and we need to figure out where we will implement everything and how.

We worked more on the compatibility of Character, Teacher, and Student in class.
We discussed additional variables that can be compared between Student and Teacher.
In addition to that, we created classes for all our teachers.
Mr. Brown is a Scorpio.
